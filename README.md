Project Title: Predictive Modelling for Click-Through-Rate Optimization at ConnectSphere Digital

This project was developed as part of a minor project submission at EdiGlobe.
The aim is to build a logistic regression model that predicts whether a user is likely to click on an online advertisement based on demographic and behavioral data. By using predictive modeling, digital agencies like ConnectSphere Digital can optimize ad targeting, reduce wasted ad spend, and improve Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Return on Ad Spend (ROAS).
